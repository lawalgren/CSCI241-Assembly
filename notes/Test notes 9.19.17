2's Complement
    !C!D  !CD  CD  C!D
!A!B  0    1    1   0
 !AB  1    0    0   1
  AB  1    0    1   1
 A!B  0    0    1   0

What's the formula? 
Y=B!D + !B!CD + ABC + !A!BD

19 (base 10) two's compelemnt byte for -19

00010011 (base 2) = 19 (base 10)
11101100 invert
      +1
11101101 = -19 base 10 in a byte format

01111111 127 base 10
10000000
01111111
      +1
10000000 -128
signed char -128 to 127
signed int (2 bytes) -32768 to 32767
